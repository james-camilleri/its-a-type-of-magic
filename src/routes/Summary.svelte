    Typo is an interactive experience with a vintage typewriter that has a life
    of its own<span class="punctuation">.</span> Animated by robotics and
    artificial intelligence<span class="punctuation">,</span> it writes poetry
    through dialogue with its human audience<span class="punctuation">.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    The mechanical typewriter is an anachronism from a bygone era<span
      class="punctuation">,</span
    >
    yet it remains a potent symbol of mechanisation and progress in art and literature<span
      class="punctuation">.</span
    >
    By splicing together the digital and the analogue<span class="punctuation"
      >,</span
    >
    we breathe new life into the machine and turn it into a primary performer<span
      class="punctuation">,</span
    >
    capable of responding to its surroundings and creating of its own accord<span
      class="punctuation">.</span
    >
    Through its exploration of AI<span class="punctuation">,</span> Typo invites
    us to question the idea of originality<span class="punctuation">,</span> and
    to grapple with our opinions of algorithmically-generated art when compared
    to pieces crafted entirely by human minds and hands<span class="punctuation"
      >.</span
    >
    When poems are a product of user input<span class="punctuation">,</span>
    complex software<span class="punctuation">,</span> and a vast digital
    library amounts of existing literature<span class="punctuation">,</span> who
    is the artist?
  </p>
  <p>
    Typo offers moments of wonder and playfulness<span class="punctuation"
      >,</span
    >
    as audiences interact with an enigmatic machine in a variety of live performances
    and experience the often vague and overly-technical world of AI in a tangible
    way<span class="punctuation">.</span> No longer a simple tool<span
      class="punctuation">,</span
    >
    Typo gains a role as an autonomous co-creator alongside its audience<span
      class="punctuation">.</span
